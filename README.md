Welcome to this makeFollow app.
The main purpose of this app is to show you nearing people.

# How it works
First to use the app you have to login or signup, after that you will access the app.

Once you access the app you can change your profile photo, and ofcourse you will see others profile photo, and they will see you.

You will see the nearing people and you can follow or ignore them.
When someone else follows you, you will receive a notification that tells you someone followed you.

That person you can ignore or you can Accept. by the time you accept he/she will become your friend.

Everytime a new person get register you will see them as near friend. ðŸ¥°

To see how many people you follow and how many followed you just click your name.

The app seems simple but it does countless work.
